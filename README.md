# Unity Rubik's Cube
An archived build of my Rubik's Cube Unity project. 

# Description
I made this Rubik's cube with the help of Megalomobile.

Swipe to rotate tiles, and right-click-swipe to rotate the cube.

**BUTTONS:**

Solve - takes a while at first for the compiler, but solves the cube quickly

Shuffle - mixes the cube up in a random sequence

Thank you!
